# Hornerhelm [Working title]

My try at a tactical fighting game. Currently in the conceptual phase only.

## Planned Features

Hornerhelm will feature tactical, individual battles against monsters which require the player to set up a team specifically planned for a certain situation.

###Battle

While the fights will remember of round-based RPGs, the game will NOT contain the typical RPG elements: Leveling the characters, looting treasures and equipping items on the characters. Instead, the game will require the player to set up a team of fighters (named 'Einherjar' in the game) specifically for every monster encounter. A lot of try and error will be necessary for the player to win a battle. 

####The 'aspects' of an einherjar

A team may consist of at max 5 einherjar. (But is not needed and not always recommended.) One einherjar has five slots for five different 'aspects'. An aspect defines the role and abilities in battle an einherjar has. One can give the five same aspects to one einherjar to make him/her especially suited for that role, or mix it up to create synergies with others aspects.
Here is a list of the five aspects and how they influence the einherjar.

##### Aspect of war
Raises melee attack power and life of the einherjar. Does not raise the ability to perform any healing or rune magic.

##### Aspect of the guardian
Raises the life points and the ability to distract monsters from other einherjar.

##### Aspect of might
Raises the potency to perform devastating rune magic, which damages all enemies. Life points will raised only a little, so be careful about attracting monster attacks.

##### Aspect of healing
Raises the efficiency to heal. Life points will also be raised only a little.

##### Aspect of the trickster
This aspect raises all abilities, but only moderatly. But in addition, the bearer of this aspect may perform abilities with thrice the efficiency or even avoid any damage completly.

#### Abilities in battle
Per round, every einherjar can perform one action. Some of them require points in that certain ability to be able to be performed.

#####Attack
Melee attacks one target.

#####Defend
Goes into a defensive stance for one round, reducing all incoming damage by 50%.

#####Rune magic
Damages all foes. Requires points in this ability.

#####Healing
Heals an einherjar. Requires points in this ability.

####General Battle Dynamic
The most important thing in battle is to defeat the enemies of course. But this won't be that easy: If all einherjar only deal damage, everyone will be dead soon because no one is healed. But even then it will be difficult to keep up with the foes, because you need at least one einherjar with the aspect of the guardian to distract them from your more squishy einherjar.
Battle will be a fine line between causing damage, defending, healing and so on.

### Background Story

In addition to the core of the game, the fights against monsters, I'll try to tell a story in a fantasy world, which is mostly based on nordic mythology.

This is the story so far:

After the apocalyptic events of the 'ragnarök', the gods are now dead, even the allfather and ruler of asgard, Odin. During the events of the ragnarök he led the 'einherjar' into battle, once fallen heros who dwelled after their deaths in the 'vallhall', spending their days drinking mead and eating pork, until they were called into battle.

When einherjar are killed, they just reappear one day later in the valhall, because they are dead anyway. And this also happened after the ragnarök: All einherjar were killed, but just reappared in the valhall. Unlike the gods.

After the death of Odin, who granted the power of the five aspects to the einherjar, the aspects were incorporated by the valkyries, formerly mere servants to Odin and his einherjar, which now rule the remnants of asgard (now: valgard) and valhall.

But even now after the war, monsters still roam the lands: giants, fenrirspawn and albs, which threaten the young human nation of Lifthrasia.

The einherjar now have to be led into battle once again!
